### What is unit testing?
Unit testing is a method of breaking your code into junks and testing those individual "units". A unit can be several different things depending on what you're trying to test. It can be a single line, a function, multiple functions etc. Depending on how detailed you want your testing to be will determine how low of level you test on.

### What is test driven development?
Test driven development is where you write the test first, and the corresponding function after. Writing the test first gives you an end goal to work towards while writing your functions, and can help simplify your code by making it very direct.

#### What are the advantages and disadvantages of test driven development?
Some of the advantages of test driven development are more focused code, being that you always have a clearly stated end goal to work towards, and easier debugging. Breaking your code down into chunks allows the developer to more easilty see where problems arise.

### What is a unit?
Like I mentioned above, a unit is a chunk of code in which you test. Common practice is to test functions to check their output. Several tests can be ran on one unit, to ensure its returning expected results.
