#### What is NPM?
NPM (Node Package Manger) is a library of open source code packages. NPM itself is consists of three different components, the website, the CLI and the registry. The website contains the registrty of packages along with documentation on how to use each package, and the CLI is the means by which you can install these packages into your project.

#### What is an NPM package/module?

A package is a directory that contains a package.json file. In order to be published to NPM, a package requires a package.json file, which provides details on the director itself like version, author, dependancies etc.

A module on the other hand is a file or directory inside the node_modules directory that contains code and can be loaded with the require() function like so:

```
const lib = require('@luibel/dgm3780')

let example = lib.discountPrice(100, 20) // equals 80
```
This example imports the @luibel/dgm3780 module, making the functions inside it useable in your code.

#### Benefits of NPM

Things like API calls, and unit testing are somewhat common in most Node and Javascript projects. Sure you could manually write code to handle these functions and features, but have them all tidied up within a package that you can easily install can speed up the development process. This like [jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest), and [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), are both great examples of dependancies that can be used for both development and production.
