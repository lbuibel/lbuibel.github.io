####  What is React?

React is a Javascript framework used to develop and build user interfaces for single page applications. React allows for the implementation of large scaleable web applications through the use of things like components.

##### Who created React?

Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook built React, which was then implemented on Facebooks news feed in 2011 and on Instagram just a later. Now days it's hard finding a web development job listing where React isn't mentioned.

#### What is state?

In React, both state and props are Javascript objects that hold information which is rendered on the DOM. Unlike props which get passed into components, state is controlled inside a component.

####  What is the difference between a functional component and a class

A functional component in React is just that, a javascript function that then returns JSX. A class based component extends a react component that then uses a render method, rather than a return method.

####  What is JSX?

Instead of using plain jane HTML for its templating, React uses what's called JSX, a form of Javascript that allows HTML tags to be processed into Javascript to later be rendered into components.

#### What does it mean to 'lift state up'?

Like mentioned before, state is data that is handled inside a React component. Occasionally there is the need to different components to use the same data, or have certain data based on the state inside another component. Lifting state up is the means of how you can use the same state, or make the same state available to use in different components.
