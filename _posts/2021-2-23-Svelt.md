####  Virtual DOM Inefficiencies

Early in the presentation when covering how virtual DOM libraries work, he gave an example of all the steps it takes with React to change one element. Stepping through each element, a decision needs to be made on whether or not to keep it the same or change it. In his example, only one thing changed, but every element still needed to be check which seems super inefficient, especially if you have a large project.

#### Simplicity
Towards the middle of the presentation he makes a comparison to internal combustion engines vs electric motors. By changing the underlying assumptions on how to achieve a goal, Tesla has been able to to create a powertrain that much more efficient and simple. Svelte is to framework programming what Tesla is to the Auto industry. It achieves a lot of the same goes, but in a much simpler easier fashion.

####  Performance

In the presentation he mentions that the mobile web is no longer the new frontier, but rather the embedded web in things like wearable, tvs, car infotainment systems etc. Svelte is both lightweight and powerful and can be ran on products like this that may not be super powerful.
