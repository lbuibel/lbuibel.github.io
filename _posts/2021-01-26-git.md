#### What is Git?

To put it simply, Git is a control system/technology that allows a user to track changes in files in both large and small projects. Being able to track files is especially important when working on large projects with many files, in a team setting, where different people may be adding different features. It can show changes made by different users, and keep track of different versions or iterations of your project as it progresses and changes.

##### What problems does it solve?

Coding is a very iterative process, and takes time. Git allows those working on a project so save their work at whatever checkpoints they wish. It also allows users to have different versions of their project going, depending on what kind of feature or changes they might be working on.

A good example would be someone who is working on a site using PHP but wants to be able to view changes they are making live without constantly uploading their project to a server/sandbox. Having one branch that can display things via html gives the user a good way to immediately view the changes they are making before moving it over to another branch that will be uploaded as the final product.

#### What is Github?

Github is tool to host your Git projects where others can access them to work collaboratively. After downloading a copy of a Git repo from Github, a user can make a branch within that repo using Git to work on new feature. After they are done working on it, they can send their changes back up to Github where they can be merged with the rest of the project for the team to view.

##### Git vs Github

When learning Git, it's an easy mistake to think that Git and Github are one and the same. In actuality, Git is the technology that actually tracks the changes in your files (git repo) and Github is the platform where this repo can be shared. Github is great when working in teams because it give everyone a central location to save their work and contribute changes.
