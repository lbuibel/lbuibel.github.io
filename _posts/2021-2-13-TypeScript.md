Breaking down what Typescript is and why it's beneficial

#### What is TypeScript?
To put it rather simply, Typescript is a "typed" version of Javascript. Typically Javascript doesn't use strict types, and the browser implicitly sets the data type based on how certain pieces of data are being used in your code. Typescript on the other had uses set types like "string" and "number", making things easy to debug, and is then transpiled to Javascript.

#### How does TypeScript help developers?

Typescript is great for developers because of how it helps keep you data types consistent, potentially helping you avoid running into "undefined" datatypes. TypeScript can also be slowly integrated into Javascript, making it easy to implement on a project, rather than requiring a total overhaul all at once.

#### What is the difference between compilation vs transpilation?

Compiling is taking code and breaking it down into something your computer can actually understand. An example of this would be a compiler taking C code and breaking it down into binary which your computer can understand.

Transpiling means taking code written in one form like TypeScript and converting it over to JavaScript. Other examples of this would be taking ES6 Javascript and having it converted over to ES5, or SCSS to CSS. Transpiling isn't breaking code down into binary like compiling does, and can typically still be read by a developer.
