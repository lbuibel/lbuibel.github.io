###### Unlike coding in movies, writing solid code requires time and research.

Researching code to complete a project or task seems to be the name of the game in web and app development. Learning how to efficiently do this research and find solutions is key to becoming a better developer. 

## How do I research on the web?

Depending on what kind of problem I'm trying to solve, knowing what resource to use comes in super handy. If it's a simple Javascript, HTML or CSS problem I'll typically jump on, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) first to find what I'm looking for. MDN is great if I need to double check the correct syntax for something, or maybe see an example or two.

If I'm using a frame-work like [vue.js](https://vuejs.org), I'll jump on their documentation to first read up on how they recommend doing something. If the documentation doesn't quite answer my question I'll then usually end up on stack overflow or youtube trying to find an example that is somewhat similar to the problem I'm trying to fix and go from there.

## Tips and Tricks

As simple as it might sound, dropping code straight into Google is something I've found to be surprisingly helpful, especially when dealing with the terminal. Often times I'll get something on the terminal that I don't understand, copying it into Google often pulls up the solution right away. Same thing goes when I'm trying to remember certain git commands for the terminal. If I can't remember exactly what the command was, searching what I'm trying to accomplish with a key word or two usually pulls up a Github article that explains how to do exactly what I'm looking for.

## What is tutorial Hell?

I'm sure there are many different definitions and interpretations of what tutorial Hell is. To me it's when I start a tutorial and get to a point in the tutorial I don't understand, that requires me watching another tutorial to understand the first tutorial and so on. Eventually I'm four tutorials deep and start to wonder what I'm even doing with my life. When I find myself this situation I often will go back to reading documentation and starting really small with my coding and building it up in increments, making sure I understand what's happening at each step.

## How do I best learn development and Javascript?

The same way I best learn most things, a lot of hands on practice. It'd be great if I could just absorb information from a lecture or video, but for me I have to do something several times to become proficient in it. I think with development and Javascript, the best way to learn it is to also learn how to be resourceful and how to successfully research and solve problems.

## How would you recommend someone new to web development learn the skill and why?

I'd probably say try and find a simple tutorial you can follow along with to see how the process of coding something works. If you like it, and find yourself geeking out on how everything comes together, try something a little more advanced or maybe try adding to your first project.

I'd also recommend trying different aspects of the development process whether it's frontend, backend, UI design or UX design. There are a lot of moving parts in the development process, and one might be more interesting to you than others, so don't be afraid to try new things.
